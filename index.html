Ever wonder what people are thinking?

I don&#x27;t. I know.

The secret isn&#x27;t in hearing people&#x27;s thoughts.

The secret is making it stop.

I&#x27;ve been doing both for as
long as I can remember.

Way before I ever heard the word telepath.

Still, when God hooked you up with free Cable (television),

You gotta think he expects
you to do a little service.

Hmm... If he could only read my mind.

I should&#x27;ve worn something else.

I need another buck.

This here is on the floor, is it yours?

Hey.

Hey. You&#x27;re late. I had to eat.

So what else is new?

We gotta go.

Can I get a cup of coffee?

Have mine.

So, were you with Olivia last night?

For a while, yeah.

Oh, that&#x27;s why you slept in.
- No, my alarm didn稚&#x27; go off.

You know, they say insomnia is a common ailment for first-year paramedics.

I don&#x27;t have insomnia.

So it&#x27;s girl troubles.

I don&#x27;t have girl troubles either.

Come on, you and Olivia get in
another fight last night?

I thought we were late.

Oh, we&#x27;re late.

That&#x27;s not bad.

I don&#x27;t tell many people about my gift.

I&#x27;m not into being the freak show at the party.

Have a good day.

Besides, who&#x27;s gonna believe me anyway?

You got any plans tonight?
- No. You?

No.

Who are you texting over there?
You&#x27;ve got another fight with Olivia.

No.

Olivia and I, we don&#x27;t fight. We ******

Well, why don&#x27;t you two just give it up?

We like hanging out together. Okay?

Did I say anything?

Is that cool with you?
-Sure, it&#x27;s your business, man.

No!

Toby, you okay?

Toby, look at me! Hey, look at me.

Is it a migraine?

I don&#x27;t get migraines.

You could&#x27;ve been having a
brain aneurism, I don&#x27;t know.

You know, in the paper, that 22 year
old swimmer just had a brain tumor.

Oz, stop. Please.

I&#x27;m okay.

I&#x27;ll be okay.

Yeah?
-Yes.

Okay.

You gotta get yourself checked out.

It&#x27;s a little too intense for me.

I know.

Wow...

What?

Is someone in there?
- Yeah, I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s conscious.

Hey, get the door.

Ma&#x27;am!

Hey, can you hear me?

We&#x27;ll get you out!

She&#x27;s conscious, Oz!

What about those doors?
- No, they won&#x27;t budge!

Ah, Toby!

We&#x27;ve gotta move!

Look what I found.
-Toby, this car is on fire.

Move your head! I need to break the window!

Careful, Toby. Careful.

We don&#x27;t have much time, Toby, hurry.

Are you okay?

You&#x27;ve got her?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on!

I was sure it was gonna blow.

It&#x27;s not a movie, Oz.
It doesn&#x27;t happen that way.

Season 01 Episode 01
&quot;I Am An Adult&quot;

Hey, no no no, relax. Relax. It&#x27;s okay,
these guys are gonna take good care of you.

Ma&#x27;am, you were alone
in the car, is that right?

Mommy!

Thanks.

We better get to work, eh?

How&#x27;s your head?
- It&#x27;s fine, thank you.

Alright, well, just in case, I&#x27;m driving today.

Alright, let&#x27;s see what Mr. silver dollar has
to say. What do you want, heads or tails?

Tails.

Tails. Drive or drive?

Drive. And I&#x27;m driving till you get
your headache checked out.

Mr. Logan, Mr. Bey.

Listen up.

Do not come to me, okay, requesting
overtime. It ain&#x27;t gonna happen.

I wouldn&#x27;t do that. *******

Yeah, I know your wouldn&#x27;t. But he would.

That little stop that you made before work?

That was off the clock.

****** overtime request form.

Tuck in that shirt, Mr. Bey.

God, I get grumpy when I can&#x27;t watch wrestling.

Mr. Ryder.
- Yeah?

I TiVo&#x27;ed that Iron Man/Doctor Z match last night.
(TiVo=digital recorder)

Are you serious?

Yeah!

You know, don&#x27;t tell me who won.

I&#x27;ll burn it for you, bring it in
tomorrow. How does that sound?

Thanks, man.

Are you six years old? You forgot your fly.

ID says her name is Anna Sokur.

Good morning, Mr. Logan.

Good morning, Dr. Fawcett.

I hear you&#x27;ve had an interesting morning.
You wanna tell me your secret?

You pull a woman from a burning wreck

That&#x27;s not worth sharing?
- Well, you know, just another day at work.

Humble and handsome. Killer combination.

Olivia, okay, wait. Alright.

Hey, what does that mean?

That I&#x27;m having second thoughts? No.
- You?

Me? No.

Good.

Yeah.

&#x27;Cause we obviously make better friends 
than we do lovers anyway, right?

Absolutely.

So no reflections on anything?
- No, I agree.

Listen, I have to go.
- So, are we on for drinks Friday?

Uhm, I&#x27;ll check my calendar.
- Right, okay.

You know, I was gonna call you and tell you tonight, about...

**** I&#x27;ve been so distracted lately.

Right. Lately.

Well, come on. You used to think 
that was kinda charming.

You really think this is gonna work?

Yeah.

If you want it to.

If you want it to, I want it to.

Why don&#x27;t you just take Oz out? 
He seems like your biggest fan anyway.

Ma&#x27;am, you were alone in 
the car. Is that right? Is that right?

Not so easy being a hero, huh?

I need to talk to you.

So, detective Marks, you&#x27;re here 
to investigate the accident?

Yeah, I came to get a statement from the victim, Anna Sokur.

But the docs have her on pain medicine. 
So I think she&#x27;s gonna be out for a while.

She say anything to you 
about what happened?

No, no, she was really out 
of it when we got there.

That&#x27;s it?
- Yeah, yeah. She&#x27;s lucky to be alive.

Okay, thanks.
- Yeah.

Uhm, actually, you know... It was a bit weird.
- What was weird?

When we got there she was jammed up on 
the passenger痴 side, like she wasn&#x27;t driving.

So, you&#x27;re saying you don&#x27;t think 
she was alone in the car.

Maybe she was tossed when 
the car was flipped. I don&#x27;t know.

Guess that&#x27;s what happens when 
you don&#x27;t wear a seatbelt, huh?

It&#x27;s true.

If you think of anything else, please give me a call.

Yeah.
- Thanks.

My pleasure.

We&#x27;re only beginning to scratch the 
surface in our understanding of the mind.

Do you really think thoughts could 
be turned into zeros and ones?

Well, we know that neurons fire. That synapses communicate. 
That memories have their own chemical signature.

But you&#x27;re implying that thought could 
be recorded? Replicated and transmitted?

Maybe one day we&#x27;ll understand 
the physics of thought

the same way we do the 
motions of the planets.

Stop me if I&#x27;m getting too out 
of it. Sometimes I can&#x27;t tell.

Excuse me a minute.

I see the Ray show is up and running again.
- Standing and rolling. How have you been, Toby?

I need to talk, Ray.

Alright, come on.

But I still don&#x27;t understand what makes this so different?
- Well, I was shut down, Ray. I wasn&#x27;t looking for contact.

The thoughts and images, everything just hit me hard, Ray.

I couldn&#x27;t stop it.

So, this woman? She was a block away?
- She might&#x27;ve been more when we first connected.

So your range is increasing.
- That&#x27;s not what this is about.

No, I get it. It scares you.

Yeah, the thoughts took over, 
I couldn&#x27;t control it.

Well, from the sound of it, 
you really helped this woman out.

You probably saved her life.

That&#x27;s not the point.
- Maybe it is the point, Toby.

Her cry for help was so intense...

it broke down the natural barriers 
between your mind and hers.

You saying I&#x27;m a human fire alarm?

Feature of the intensity of 
the sender and the receiver.

Do you remember how I was when 
they first brought me to you?

You were a child.

There was no way you could cope with
that kind of assault on the senses.

I always thought you&#x27;d reach 
a certain threshold.

I don&#x27;t want to do one 
of your experiments.

This may be a very good thing, Toby.

No, it isn&#x27;t. It didn&#x27;t
knock you on your ass.

There&#x27;s something else.

No.

I have to do something. I might be the only 
one who can help this woman find her child.

Be careful, Toby.

No one can know about you.

Thanks.

Hey.
- Hey.

How&#x27;s she doing?

She&#x27;s better. She&#x27;s a little groggy, but it looks 
like she should be out of her in a couple of days.

The police are here to take a statement, 
but she won&#x27;t talk to them.

You don&#x27;t mind if I try?

I just wanna see if I can help her out.

Right, and since when do 
you do bedside service?

Well, you see? Maybe I&#x27;ve 
changed more than you thought.

Hey, how are you doing?

I&#x27;m Toby Logan. I was the guy 
that got you out of the car, there.

That was pretty close, huh? 
How are you feeling?

Should I tell him?

Did you remember what happened 
to you before the accident?

My God, he shot him!

Give me the keys!

A man cut me off.

I didn&#x27;t see his face.

You don&#x27;t remember anything else?

If you tell anyone, I&#x27;ll kill the kid.

Mommy!

Someone took your son 
from you, didn&#x27;t they?

You gotta tell the police what happened.

Get out. Get out.

Get out!

I know what you&#x27;re thinking.

The car wreck. I hesitated.

No you don&#x27;t Oz, it&#x27;s...

Now, look. To the untrained eye it 
might&#x27;ve seemed like I was scared.

You never hesitated.

What?
- Yeah, I saw you, man.

You were assessing the situation. 
You were sizing up a plan.

Exactly.

Yeah, absolutely. Now, had you not done that, 
maybe we wouldn&#x27;t have got her out,

Maybe I would&#x27;ve been blown up too.

I guess you could say that I saved all our lives.

I guess you could kinda say that.

Yeah, well, Toby, I just want you to 
know that, uhm, I&#x27;m watching your back.

I know you got my back, man.

Hey, Toby. Watch your back.
- Alright.

Toby.

What exactly did you say to her?

Who?
- Anna Sokur, that accident victim you brought in yesterday?

Nothing, I just... Why, what&#x27;s this about?

She&#x27;s gone. And she disappeared 
sometime after you spoke to her.

Are you kid... Liv, I didn&#x27;t say anything to her...
- She&#x27;s in bad shape. She&#x27;s got a concussion...

I tried to put in a phone call to 
the cops to check up on her, but...

they pretty much blew me off.

Alright, so you want me to out there and find her?
- Yeah, she obviously doesn&#x27;t realize how bad her condition is.

Here&#x27;s her address. Find her. Before she walks in front of a truck, okay?

This it?
- Yeah.

Alright, so, I&#x27;ll be five minutes, is that cool?
- If she&#x27;s there.

You got a better place to look?

I&#x27;m taking a cup of coffee.

Can I get a double double?
- Shot of vanilla?

How do you do that? It&#x27;s like, 
I don&#x27;t know, you read my mind...

Yeah, it&#x27;s a gift.

It&#x27;s amazing, really.

You don&#x27;t know who you&#x27;re dealing with. 
I have your son. Someone will call.

Anna, hello?

Hello? Anna!

Oh, hey. How are you doing? Do you know 
the girl in this apartment? Anna Sokur?

Off course.
- Okay, she been by today?

No.

Don&#x27;t tell anybody you&#x27;ve seen me, okay?

You know, she probably told 
you not to tell anyone.

Does Anna Sokur live here?

I haven&#x27;t seen her.

Anna?

Toby Logan from the hospital.

&quot;Early Rainbow Room Day Care&quot;.

Logan?

What are you doing here?

Dr. Fawcett told me that Anna 
took off from the hospital.

And she wanted me to see if she was here.
- So how did you get in?

The door was open.

Can I see your keys?
- What?

Your keys, can I have a look at them?

Yeah.

Here.
- Well, look at this.

Those are the keys to my bike lock.

Actually, it&#x27;s a bump key. The only thing to get you through a tumble lock faster is a ****.

So this how you do it? You drive them to the 
hospital and you come back with a shopping list?

No, that&#x27;s not how I do it.

Let&#x27;s say we get a call from a 
widow who&#x27;s gone into cardiac arrest...

we show up and the door is locked and
we have to wait for you guys to show up...

to bust the door down.

And while we&#x27;re waiting, the patient dies.

Excuse me.

Oh, uh, a simple question for you.

Who&#x27;s taking care of Anna&#x27;s son?

What son?

Well, while I was in there stealing 
craft dinner and paper plates,

I noticed a picture of her and a boy.

And you assumed it was her son?

Oh yeah, that&#x27;s right. She said 
she didn&#x27;t have a family.

Why would she lie?

Well, maybe she&#x27;s afraid Social 
Services would come and take him.

Might explain why she left 
the hospital in such a hurry.

So she&#x27;s out there with a head injury. 
Who&#x27;s taking care of her kid?

No!

Oh God!

Look, Anna. That&#x27;s your name, isn&#x27;t it?

I told you to use the phone I left you.

Don&#x27;t play games with me. Call.

Nicky?

Hey kid.

Nicky!

What are you doing down there?

I was scared.

Scared of what?

The people you said 
would come and get me.

Okay, listen, I told you. 
You&#x27;d be safe here, alright?

Nobody can find you.

Get out of there.

I&#x27;m sorry, Mister.
- Come here.

Listen to me, okay?

I told you to sit in there and watch TV.

When is my mommy coming?
- I don&#x27;t know.

It&#x27;s gonna be over real soon, okay. 
We&#x27;re gonna figure this out.

We&#x27;re gonna figure this out, and uhm...

I&#x27;m just gonna get in touch with your mother.

Yeah, let&#x27;s call her.

Hey, Anna.

I&#x27;m getting really disappointed 
that I keep hearing this machine.

Nicky and I really need to see you.

He&#x27;s scared.

Next time I call, I hope you&#x27;re there.

Just stay by the phone!

You wanted to talk to your mother?

Hi mommy. I miss you. And I wish you could get here.

I love you, mommy.

God.

Mommy!

If you tell anyone I&#x27;ll kill the kid!

Get out!

Your name is Toby. Say it.
- Toby.

Toby Logan. Say it again.
- Toby Logan.

That&#x27;s the only name 
you&#x27;ve ever had, okay?

Toby?
- Ray?

I knocked. The door was open.

I haven&#x27;t heard from you. 
I left you a couple of messages.

Oh, no, I just uhm... I&#x27;m a little...

You don&#x27;t have to read my mind to 
know I&#x27;m worried about you.

And I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more 
going on than you want out there.

Oh, Ray, it&#x27;s just this change, somehow... 
It&#x27;s making me remember my past.

How far back?

I can&#x27;t piece it together, 
it&#x27;s all fragmented.

I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s things 
I wanna remember.

What are you afraid of, Toby?

From what little I know about 
my mother, she had the gift too.

She was possessed by the voices.

They drove her out of her mind.

You afraid that&#x27;s what&#x27;s 
gonna happen to you?

Yeah, wouldn&#x27;t you be?

We&#x27;ll get through this.

That looked serious. Is everything okay?

Yeah, it&#x27;s alright. It&#x27;s Jake King, 
he&#x27;s in undercover with the 35.

He hasn&#x27;t checked into his CO for a couple of days or 
anyone on his team. I&#x27;m just keeping an eye on him. That&#x27;s all.

How&#x27;s your case coming?

A lot of dead ends.

What you got?

Anna Sokur, 28, single mom. 
Works at a local diner.

They haven&#x27;t seen her in two days.

Father?

Not in the picture.

Check out her place?

Yes. Super says she pays her rent 
on time and keeps out of trouble.

How about the kid?

What about him?
- How old is he?

From the picture I got, maybe 5.

I went to his day care, 
they haven&#x27;t seen her.

I have a parent list.

Parents mingle, so if she&#x27;s in trouble or she&#x27;s 
scared, maybe she confided in someone.

Alright, let me know what you find.

It&#x27;s odd. I saw her car pull up, 
but they never came in.

Sorry I can&#x27;t be more help.
- I&#x27;m sure *****.

Okay, good luck with that.
- Thank you.

Oh my God! He&#x27;s shot him!

So you&#x27;re so worried about this boy

that you came all the way to a day 
care to see if anyone knew anything?

Yeah, yeah, and you were right. 
No one knew anything.

How&#x27;d you know about the car?

Well, these little kids as I was walking came up to 
me and said that I should check out this car.

It&#x27;s been here for a few days.

And these kids just conveniently disappear 
and you, out of idle curiosity, pop the trunk?

Yeah, idle curiosity.

Yeah, and then you decide to pick 
up the phone and call me. Why me?

Because you&#x27;re the only detective I know.

What is with this big turnout? 
Is this guy important or something?

He was a cop.

No kidding?

The entire force is gonna be over this. Especially his partner.

You&#x27;re the guy that found the body?

Yeah, that&#x27;s right.

Every cop in the city was 
out looking for my partner

and some off duty paramedic 
finds him. How does that happen?

Mike, relax.

**** somebody killed my partner. You better 
believe I&#x27;m gonna be all over this.

You have no idea who did this?

No. Who is this guy?

You understand, I have a partner. 
I know where he is all the time.

I mean, you gotta have some 
idea why this happened.

What are you trying to say?
- Mike!

What are you trying to say to me?

****. I&#x27;m turning myself in!
- Put the gun down!

No!

What are you trying to say, huh?

We&#x27;ll handle this.

What the hell was that about?
- I don&#x27;t know.

I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m sorry.

Well, you&#x27;re still gonna have to come to 
the station and give an official statement.

Let&#x27;s go.

Let&#x27;s go!

Earlier today, the body of a 
Police officer of the 35 division...

was found in the trunk of a car parked outside the 
Early Rainbow Room Day Care in downtown Toronto.

You Anna?

Gerry from the pawn shop told me to give you this.

Yeah, yeah. Okay fine.

We don&#x27;t need any formal introductions.

Do you have 200 bucks?

Yeah.

Okay. Look , you&#x27;ve got choices.
- I just want a gun.

Okay. Automatic, semi-auto, revolver?
- I don&#x27;t care.

Yeah, okay.

This is a .38 caliber. It&#x27;s lightweight, 
dependable on short range.

You gonna get in close?

I don&#x27;t know.

Okay, look. The serial number 
is gone. It&#x27;s untraceable.

You do know how to hold 
one of these, right?

No.

It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re shaking his hand.

Thank you.

Here you go. First time bonus on me.

So how much do you know about 
this dead guy&#x27;s partner?

Henderson?

He&#x27;s a guys guy.

Probably came at you because 
you stepped over the line.

What if he had something to do with it?
- With what?

His partner is dead.

You think he killed his partner?

A woman and a kid go missing for two days.

A cop goes missing, the cop is found 
in the trunk near the kid&#x27;s day care.

The day care worker says the woman 
was there the morning of the accident.

What if she witnessed the murder?

Wrong place at the wrong time?

If you need anything, call.

Alright.

Sorry, Mike.

Who is this guy?

But we still don&#x27;t know where 
the woman or her kid are.

Unless off course you can enlighten me.

I don&#x27;t know where she is.

She said she was scared of something
and that she couldn&#x27;t go to the cops.

And you just remembered this now? 
Why didn&#x27;t you say anything?

Well, you told me to stay out of our business.

Marks.

I&#x27;ll be right back.

Nicky, Nicky!

Mommy!

You gotta open the door, okay?

Just turn the lock.

I was expecting a call, 
but I&#x27;m glad you dropped by.

You got a reason for going 
through that stuff?

Hey, how are you doing?

I&#x27;m doing fine.
- Good.

How&#x27;d you get in here?

Mike left the door open for me, said he
was gonna be by in a few minutes.

He left for his cabin a half hour ago.

He hasn&#x27;t left for the 
cabin already, has he?

Mike and I are pretty close, 
being neighbors and all.

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen you around before.

So where&#x27;s this place?

Mike&#x27;s cabin.

Old Heart Lake ****.

Oh, Heart Lake.

You know, maybe I&#x27;ll just drive up there myself.

Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
- Thank you.

This is Charlie Marks, leave a message.

Detective Marks, listen, it&#x27;s Toby Logan.

Henderson has Anna Sokur.

His neighbor told me he&#x27;s taking 
them up to his lodge on Heart Lake.

North on highway 47.

I&#x27;ve played poker up there. 
It&#x27;s about an hour north of here.

Let&#x27;s just hope we have an hour.

Logan, this is Detective Marks. Give me a call back now.

Look, I won&#x27;t say anything. 
Please. Please just let us go.

It&#x27;s alright mommy. He&#x27;s a 
Policeman. He&#x27;ll protect us.

That&#x27;s right, Nicky.

That&#x27;s all I want.

It&#x27;s to protect you and your mom.

And everybody from all the bad people.

I want you to sit here, Nicky.

I wanna sit with my mommy.

I want you to sit here.

I&#x27;ll have to do something now. 
I&#x27;ll have to take them into the woods.

Please. Just let us go, 
I won&#x27;t say anything.

I can&#x27;t do that.

I didn&#x27;t see anything.

Don&#x27;t lie to me!

You saw us that morning!

We&#x27;re gonna go for a walk.

No!

This has to end now.

Just do whatever you want 
to me, just let my baby go.

We&#x27;re going for a walk.

Come on. Run, Nicky!

Oh no!

It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s okay.

There&#x27;s nowhere to run now.

Henderson! Henderson!

You don&#x27;t have to do this.

How the hell did you know?

They have nothing to do 
with this. They&#x27;re innocent.

Your partner&#x27;s death, 
I know it was an accident.

I know you didn&#x27;t mean to.

You don&#x27;t know anything.

I know you are a good cop.

You can stop it right now.

Henderson, let them go, man.

I have to finish this.

No!

Grab my hand! Come here, grab my hand!

Grab his hand.

Come here. Grab my hand.

Nicky, look at me. You can trust me.

Take my hand.

Good boy. Come on.

So, what is it with you?
- What do you mean?

How&#x27;d you know Henderson was bad?
And don&#x27;t say it was a hunch.

Okay. I have a gift.

You have a gift?

Don&#x27;t we all? Nice to meet you, Toby.

You too, Detective.

So, I hear you&#x27;ve had a 
rough couple of days.

Yeah, it&#x27;s been interesting.

You&#x27;re not gonna tell me 
about it, are you?

Do you wanna grab a drink?
I could tell you all about it.

I&#x27;m off in an hour.

Sounds good.

Great.

All my life, I told myself: &quot;Turn it off, 
shut it down, make it go away&quot;.

Today I broke the rule. I stopped looking 
the other way and I saw the truth.

This isn&#x27;t a curse, it&#x27;s a gift.
